# clash-conf

Thanks to: https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR

  This is just a config that creates nice groups based on the tool on the website above.
  I'm not the owner neither creator of this tool. I just used it to create some nice groups.
  If you want more customizations you also can create it by yourself or help me improove this one here.
  
  Convert your subscription to a groups subscription using this page: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/it-global-architect/clash-conf/blob/main/clash-groups-creator.html
  
  Add the new generated subscription to your clash.
  
  To see the groups open YACD from you clash panel. I suggest you to bookmark YACD address so you don't need to open clash anymore.
  
  Main Group:
  All the sites and services that does not fit another group.
  Suggestion to use All Auto to get the fastest server around
  
  Streaming groups (Disney, Netflix, HBO,...):
  Choose the region of your preference. 
  
  China Group:
  Chinese websites and other sites that are not blocked in China. Just set as direct connection for better performance and avoid errors.
  
  Brazil Relay:
  It uses a relay system to reach Brazil in a very fast way. This is good to unlock Disney, HBO, Netflix....
  
  Microsoft and Apple Groups: Both usually works better with direct connection but sometimes we need to use VPN for it.
  
  Global:
  This is default and not used for nothing as far as I know.
  
  BJ-Share Group: This is a private customization, just ignore it.
  
  Source IP group: This is a private customization, it bypass any other configuration for devices with the ip range from 192.168.3.248 to 192.168.3.254
