# clash-conf

Thanks to: https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR

  This is just a config that creates nice groups based on the tool on the website above.
  I'm not the owner neither creator of this tool. I just used it to create some nice groups.
  If you want more customizations you also can create it by yourself or help me improove this one here.
  
  
  
  Main Group:
  All the sites and services that does not fit another group.
  Suggestion to use All Auto to get the fastest server around
  
  Streaming groups (Disney, Netflix, HBO,...):
  Choose the region of your preference. 
  
  China Group:
  Chinese websites and other sites that are not blocked in China
  
  Brazil Relay:
  It uses a relay system to reach Brazil in a very fast way. This is good to unlock Disney, HBO, Netflix....
  
  Microsoft and Apple Groups: Both usually works better with direct connection but sometimes we need to use VPN for it.
  
  Global:
  This is default and not used for nothing as far as I know.
  
  BJ-Share Group: This is a private customization, just ignore it.
  
  Source IP group: This is a private customization, it bypass any other configuration for devices with the ip range from 192.168.3.248 to 192.168.3.254
